\section{Introduction}
Similarity is a complex concept. In this project we 
are going to use LCS (Longest Common Sequence) to find 
some scores to decide how similar two documents are to 
each other. Then we improve the functionality and try to 
solve a harder problem of searching similar documents 
based on a document at hand on the Internet to see if 
there exists contents that are close or they contain 
in the document. The second part of the project needs 
web scraping that is a complex problem by itself. At 
first, to simplify the task we only look on some 
specified websites that we know the format of their 
contents and can extract those. Then we make the 
problem harder and try to find some optimized method 
to solve the problem in a general way.
