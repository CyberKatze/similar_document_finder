\section{Similarity Score}
Now that we can find the LCS, how we can say how much the documents are similar?
One of the methods is used in statistics to estimate similarity of two sets is \textbf{Jaccard
similarity coefficient}.
\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index}}
The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union and 
the Jaccard similarity coefficient 
(originally given the French name coefficient de 
communaut√© by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for 
gauging the similarity and diversity of sample sets. 
The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite 
sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection 
divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:jaccard}
  J(A,B) = \frac{|A\cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
\end{equation}

There is only a subtlety here, in LCS we don't find the intersectons.
So we can amend the forumla this way:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:jacc2}
  J'(A,B) = \frac{|LCS(A,B)|}{|A|+ |B|-|LCS(A,B)| }
\end{equation}
\subsection{Implementing Similarity Score in Python}
Python implementation is shown in the Listing \ref{lis:jacc}.
\begin{python}[caption=jaccard similarity rate, label=lis:jacc]
def sim_rate(t1, t2, lcs):
    '''
    t1: list of words
    t2: list of words
    lcs: longest common sequence of t1 and t2
    return: similarity rate and including rate.'''
    rate = len(lcs)/(len(t1)+len(t2)-len(lcs))

    return rate
\end{python}
